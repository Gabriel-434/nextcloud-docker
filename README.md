<a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> deployment made easy.
</p>


## Why?
Well, I used deploying Nextcloud as an excuse (there is already an [official image](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one)) to familiarize myself more with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and its best practices.


## Seamless Deployment
Copy the [dot env file template](.env.example) and populate it.
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Create the `credentials` directory and the files that contain the [Docker Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/09-secrets/), then populate the credentials with secure passwords.
```sh
mkdir credentials

# PostgreSQL database password
touch credentials/postgres_password.txt

# The password of the Nextcloud admin user
touch credentials/nextcloud_admin_password.txt

# Collabora Office administration password
touch credentials/collabora_password.txt
```

Pull and start the containers in the [Docker Compose file](docker-compose.yml).
```sh
docker compose pull

docker compose up -d
```

Thats it ðŸŽ‰, now you have your own Nextcloud instance up and running.
